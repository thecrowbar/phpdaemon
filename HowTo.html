			<h2>Basic HowTo for phpdaemon</h2>
			<h4>What this HowTo covers:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Creating a simple appInstance</li>
				<li>Presenting a web frontend to communicate with the appInstance</li>
				<li>Communicating with the appInstance over a websocket (tested in Google Chrome only)</li>
				<li>Establish TCP socket connection to remote host and send/receive data</li>
				<li>Store/Retrieve data from MySQL server using MySQL client built into phpdaemon</li>
				<li>Some simple notes on closures in PHP. Note: I am just learning how to use closures so be warned.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><strong>Installation:</strong> Detailed installation instructions 
				on my site at <a href="http://jamesmcrow.com/node/4">phpdaemon Install on Ubuntu 12.04</a>
				. Basically just clone the repo into /opt/phpdaemon and link /usr/local/bin/phpd to /opt/phpdaemon/bin/phpd.
				Configuration will be covered throughout the tutorial
			</p>
			<p><strong>Initial Configuration:</strong> To start just copy and paste this file into /opt/phpdaemon/conf/phpd.conf</p>
			<pre>
## Config file

user nobody;
group nobody;

max-workers	1;
min-workers	1;
start-workers	1;
max-idle	0;


Pool:HTTPServer {
	# you can redefine default settings for FastCGI
	#privileged;
	port 8000;
	#listen 127.0.0.1;
	#responder "ServerStatus";
	#responder "Example";
}

Pool:WebSocketServer {
#	listen-port 8047;
#	listen 127.0.0.1;
}

Vendor {
	sqlhost '127.0.0.1';
	sqluser 'test';
	sqlpass 'password';
	sqldb 'test_db';
	sqltable 'test_table';
	vendorhosts '127.0.0.1';
	vendorport '12345';
	trans_query = 'SELECT * 
		FROM test_table';
}

			</pre> <p>This configures the HTTP server to listen on port 8000 instead 
			of the usual port 80. The WebSocket server is also enabled. The Vendor
			section holds the details for the new appInstance. Everything should 
			be fairly self explanatory. We will start a netcat instance to listen 
			on port 12345 to see what is sent and allow us to respond.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Init script:</strong> For Ubuntu 12.04 I created a basic 
				script to start/stop phpd. It is in the init-scripts directory. 
				Copy it to /etc/init.d and rename to just phpd. Then to control phpdaemon:
			<ul><li>Start: sudo service phpd start</li>
				<li>Stop: sudo service phpd stop</li>
			</ul>
			RedHat based distributions can use the script named phpd from the init-scripts directory.
			
			</p>
			
			<p><strong>MySQL Setup:</strong> You will need MySQl configured with a user named "test" with password "password."
			Feel free to adjust the configuration file to use a different account. You will 
			also need a test database and table. I used test_db and test_table, respectively.
			Make sure the test table has an id column as its first column. The id column
			should be AUTH_INCREMENT and type INT. Ensure the test_table has a few columns, 
			the example here will use all the columns from the table. Keep the column count low; maybe 4 or 5 to start with.  
			Also make sure you insert a few rows of data.</p>
			
			<p><strong>First Run:</strong> Start netcat to act as the remote server. (nc -klvnp 12345). 
				Start the phpdaemon service. Output should look something like this:</p>
			<pre>
$ sudo service phpd start
 * Starting php daemon phpd                                                                                                                                        * Starting the phpd daemon. start-stop-daemon return status: 0
[PHPD] M#23686 Pool-HTTPServer up.
[PHPD] M#23686 Pool-WebSocketServer up.
[warn] Added a signal to event base 0x29cd050 with signals already added to event_base 0x29aed90.  Only one can have signals at a time with the epoll backend.  The base with the most recently added signal or the most recent event_base_loop() call gets preference; do not rely on this behavior in future Libevent versions.
[PHPD] W#23692 Vendor up.
[PHPD] VendorClientConnection::onConnected called. Connected to host:127.0.0.1
[PHPD] W#23692 ServerStatus up.
[PHPD] Vendor connected at 127.0.0.1:12345
[PHPD] Adding a callback for event: data_recvd
[PHPD] Adding a callback for event: disconnect
[PHPD] Adding a callback for event: data_sent

			</pre><p>During phpdaemon startup you should see the VEndor app starting as well as,
				the connection to 127.0.0.1:12345.<br />
			Now try to connect to localhost on port 8000. <a href="http://localhost:8000/Vendor/">http://localhost:8000/Vendor/</a>
		Note: Make sure you include the trailing slash. The regex in AppResolver.php 
		searches for the trailing slash and will not match without it.</p>
			
			<p>You should see a simple page open listing the items from your test table. 
				Watch the console where you started phpd for any errors.</p>
			
			<p>When you click on a row in the HTML table, JavaScript will first 
			open a websocket, and then send a JSON encoded object to phpd. This 
			object will contain a command (send_trans in the example) and a trans_id 
			(this comes from the database).</p>
		
			<p><strong>Vendor Class:</strong> The Vendor class contains the main program 
			(an extension of appInstance from the base phpdaemon code). It creates 
			the MySQL connection as well as establishes the initial TCP connection 
			to the remote TCP socket. In addition, Vendor also establishes the 
			WebSocket route so websocket requests get handled correctly.</p>
			
			<p><strong>VendorWebSocketRoute:</strong> VendorWebSocketRoute handles 
			the incoming websocket requests. It has an onFrame() method that gets 
			called when new data arrives from the websocket.</p>
